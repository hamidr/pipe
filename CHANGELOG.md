### Changed
- Synced ADR statuses and TRACKER.md with shipped work
- Prepared crate metadata for crates.io publishing (version fields, keywords)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **pipe-grpc** crate (v0.1.0): tonic `Streaming<T>` source, server response adapter, TLS/mTLS server builder
- Re-exported tonic types from pipe-grpc so users don't need a direct tonic dependency

### Changed
- Rewrote README for clarity and narrative flow

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- WebSocket source + sink in pipe-http (lazy connect, cloneable sender, automatic ping/pong)

### Fixed
- WebSocket implementation: lazy connect, channel-based sender, safety improvements
- Code quality: docs, examples, duplicate Arc::clone

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **pipe-http** crate: SSE source with auto-reconnect, exponential backoff, Last-Event-ID resume
- ADR-001: operator fusion strategy (deferred)
- ADR-002: connector strategy (SSE -> WebSocket -> brokers)

### Fixed
- SSE implementation: security, correctness, and test coverage

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- Integer overflow in PullChunks group calculation
- Integer overflow in intersperse capacity calculation
- OOM prevention: max line length limit in PullLines

### Added
- Safety documentation for tcp_server timeout, file path traversal, lossy UTF-8, distinct memory cost, group_adjacent_by unbounded groups

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Reworked `#[pipe_fn]` to generate functions instead of structs
- Vec::retain in PullFilter for in-place filtering
- Reuse Vec allocation in PullAndThen across chunks
- Replace oneshot channels with JoinHandles in par_eval_map
- Use Arc::try_unwrap in broadcast receiver to avoid cloning

### Added
- `#[pipe_fn]` macro to derive Operator from async functions
- `PipeResult<T>` type alias

### Fixed
- Error handling, safety, and testing improvements across codebase

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Topic pub/sub primitive for multi-subscriber streaming
- Signal reactive state primitive and Pipe::hold
- switch_map operator (latest-wins stream switching)
- distinct / distinct_by operators for deduplication
- changes operator (emit only on value change)
- group_adjacent_by operator (consecutive grouping)
- on_finalize combinator (lightweight cleanup)
- delay_by operator (per-element delay)
- reduce terminal (fold without initial value)
- par_join / par_join_unbounded for concurrent stream merging
- generate_once / pipe_gen_once! for single-use sources
- eval_for_each async terminal

### Fixed
- par_eval_map: acquire permit before spawning
- bracket: release receives resource via Arc
- Error swallowing in prefetch, merge, debounce, generate, generate_once
- switch_map error propagation and task cleanup
- partition abort handle sharing
- Asserted chunks size > 0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-11

- sliding_window, unzip, interleave, intersperse, flatten, throttle, debounce
- repeat, repeat_with, interval constructors
- par_eval_map / par_eval_map_unordered
- Pipe::generate for ergonomic async sources
- Sink trait for composable output destinations
- chunks_timeout and timeout combinators
- Transform trait for composable stream transforms
- bracket combinator for resource safety
- Integration tests for complex pipeline flows

### Changed
- Pipe<B> is now cloneable via factory pattern
- PipeError replaced type alias with typed error enum
- Reduced allocations on hot paths
- Broadcast and partition are fully lazy

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
